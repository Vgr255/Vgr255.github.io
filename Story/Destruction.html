    <h1>Destruction of the ICS and retreat into the Void</h1>
    <h2>Date: 2042</h2>

    <p>"30 seconds to contact," a man says, his voice echoing a few kilometres away in the ICS' control center. Rachel is still at her terminal, monitoring the activities, and a man is standing in the middle, looking at the satellite plans and street cameras. He's about to finally wrap this case, which had been lingering for years upon years.</p>

    <p>Walking at a slow but steady pace, the man who spoke is about to reach his target. He's almost within range, but then he stops and turns around, looking at the ICS building.</p>

    <p>The one who seems to be the operation leader looks at the screen, and says "What's wrong? Get him, now!", but the agent replies with "Rachel... A portal to the Void is being opened... And I'm not the one doing it"</p>

    <p>Rachel, back at the command center, switches some screens and looks at a satellite view of the city, only to see a portal effectively being opened hundreds of metres above the ICS.</p>

    <p>By then, everyone in town had turned to look at this new sight, and the agent is running towards the ICS. "Rachel!", he shouts, "Evacuate the ICS! This is stronger than anything we've fought before!"</p>

    <p>Immediately, she triggers the evacuation protocol, and orders everyone to leave the building, witnessed by the obviously displeased operation leader, but he doesn't try to stop her.</p>

    <p>"Jordan," she says, "Open a portal for Quan, and leave it open."</p>

    <p>But he didn't need her orders to do so. He was already in the process of opening a portal, and almost as soon as he was done, a young boy comes out of it. Jordan looks at him, and quickly says "Come on Quan, get to the ICS, Rachel's waiting for you."</p>

    <p>The young boy named Quan runs through the cars and quickly to the ICS, while Jordan makes his way through the portal.</p>

    <p>***</p>

    <p>Just before it hits her, Diana manages to catch the projectiles hurled at her and uses them as her own weapon. She surfs around some enemies and throws back the projectiles.</p>

    <p>Just at her side, Alexander does a backflip and deviates an attack using his sword, then generates a large energy line that goes to slash against his assailants.</p>

    <p>A giant bird-like animal comes hurling at Alexander while he's counter-attacking, but is quickly struck down by Noémye, with her spear. She then jumps off it and towards another volatile.</p>
