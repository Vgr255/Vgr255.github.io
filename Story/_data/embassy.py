Set: Near an unknown embassy, in the parking lot. Victor Morika is fighting with two people, a couple of a man and a woman. \
Surrounding the embassy is a seemingly-endless and tall forest.

Morika had just knocked the man out on the ground. Quickly, he runs towards the couple's daughter, who had been \
watching aside for the whole time, grabs her arm, and proceeds to run towards the embassy.

The girl has her hair down her back tied in a uniform braid. She is young, and does not resist when Victor brings her towards the embassy.

"Don't let them in!", he shouts at the guards just outside the embassy. As he moves onwards, the girl suddenly feels \
heavy and tired.

He shouts warnings in the main hall where people are talking, and makes quick way to the staircase. \
Knowing that his time is short, he quickly runs up the stairs, closely followed by the girl.

At the top awaits Brandon, with something that looks like an odd mix between a backpack and a harness. \
He gives it to Victor, who quickly puts it on his back. He pulls the girl forward, pressing her against his chest, \
and binds her with some straps. She's weak at this point, and seems to be about to pass out.

Footsteps are heard coming from the staircase. Quickly, Brandon, runs behind the stairwell to hide, just as the \
couple emerges from the stairs. Victor stands on the ledge, facing them with their daughter attached to him. During \
the split second that they hesitate to move, Morika falls backwards into space.

They rush to try to catch him, but he's already falling at a high speed down the tall building, almost reaching the \
trees' peaks. Halfway through, he deploys two large wings from his backpack and flies into the horizon, out of reach. \
Behind them, Brandon silently makes his way down the stairs.

"Victor, she's awake," says the man sitting next to her. She sits up, already feeling much better.

The man called Victor approached. It was the man who got her away from her parents at the embassy. \
She didn't know if she was happy or sad about that. It seemed like a good idea when her parents were \
down on the ground, but when she entered the embassy's vicinity, she started to weaken.

"You didn't realize it, right?", the first man said, "You survive thanks to magic."

"But... why did... I feel dead when entering that place?"

"It's because that embassy has a special protection field, and blocks all magic. It also permanently \
blocked your parents' abilities as long as you don't grant them power again. They were neutralized and \
are being detained as we speak."

"So, I... am free?", she asks with hesitation. "If you want. We're not going to hold you back, but we would \
really like to have you on our team," Victor replies.

A woman appears, and looks at her. "She'll do," she says simply, turns around and walks back out without \
any further word.

"Who..." she begins, but is promptly interrupted by the first man, "She's Zoe, our leader. Yours too, \
if you so choose."

"If I join... Will that make me stronger? To defend myself?"

"Yes. We'll train you and make the best of your abilities," Victor says.

"Then... I'll join... I'm Evelyn," she concludes after some thinking.

"I expected as much. I'm Victor, and this man here is Luke. Welcome aboard."
