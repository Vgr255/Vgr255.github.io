DATA = """

Set: In a crowded place in Moscow, near a small cafe, surrounded by skyscrapers. The year is 2014.

Phaleën is sitting at a table, and had just ordered a coffee for himself. He has a laptop case next to \
him and is waiting for someone. A few kilometers away, Luke Walker is sitting in front of a computer in \
a small hideout.

After a few minutes, a man sits in front of Phaleën and hands him a USB key. He pulls out a used laptop \
from the case, and plugs in the key. He looks and skims through the files. After a few minutes, he pulls \
out the key, puts it in his pocket and sets the laptop back in its case.

"It's clean. These are the files we needed," he says. Moments later, a young chinese girl comes around the \
corner carrying a suitcase. She comes to their table, bows to Phaleën, and puts the suitcase on the table. \
Phaleën turns a few knobs, and the suitcase pops open.

He turns it around, and the man looks into it carefully. He nods and closes the suitcase. Phaleën stands up, \
nods at the man, and then heads back with the girl, holding her arm as if he wanted to make sure she didn't escape.

A gunshot is heard, and Phaleën turns around just as a long 50mm bullet hits his head, bouncing off the \
protective shield he erected around them. Phaleën releases his grip on the girl's arm, who instantly turns \
around. She pulls two guns out of nowhere, aims at the sniper who shot at them, and shoots magical projectiles \
out of her guns.

Through a hand wave, she makes her projectiles explode atop a skyscraper, possibly killing off the sniper. \
Phaleën looks at the man now running through the commotion, then turns around and walks off.

The chinese attendee runs up to him, "Lane, aren't you going to go off after him?", she asks. He pulls out a \
set of keys from his pocket, and unlocks the car close to them. "We got what we needed, it doesn't matter at \
this point," he replies. "But," she begins, promptly interrupted by him, "Listen, Xu, sometimes you need to \
stop trying to make justice. We got what we needed, the rest doesn't matter. Let's just move on, Luke's \
waiting on us."

She sighs, and gets in the car along him. She'd have loved to just kill that man and get back what was in \
the suitcase - what was it anyway? It wasn't money, but what could it be? She tried to forget about it, and \
instead focus on what they needed to do next.
