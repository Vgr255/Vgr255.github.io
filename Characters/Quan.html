    <h2><b>Summary:</b></h2>
    Quan is a young-looking boy who can replicate what he saw other people do, and learn it. Just like his friends, when he dies outside of the Void, he automatically gets back in it, in the way he was when he left it. Unlike the others, though, he doesn't forget what happened before he died. He often uses that skill to go on Earth, gather information, die and relay the information to his peers, acting as an informant.

    <h2><b>Abilities:</b></h2>
    He can learn anything just from seeing other people do it. His main strength is the knowledge he accumulated in all those years, in a quick fashion. He often helps Zoe and the others coordinate everything, and evaluating the safest place to stay. He's one of the two masterminds of the group, along with Rachel, despite his apparent young age.

    <h2><b>Backstory:</b></h2>
    He was born in Denmark, and Rachel recruited him when he was still young. He retained his young looks, and treated Rachel like a mother. She taught him most of what he knows, and he learned a lot from just wandering around the world and observing people.

    <h2><b>Highlights:</b></h2>
    During <b>The Invasion</b>, with the help of Jordan and Diana, he goes back to the ICS to warn Rachel and order evacuation. Rachel orders the evacuation and Quan begins to connect and charge the EMP, to destroy all computer gear and information before the ICS gets destroyed. He perishes in the explosion of the building, but gets back in the Void after.
