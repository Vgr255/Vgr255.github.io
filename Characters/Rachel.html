    <h2><b>Summary:</b></h2>
    Rachel is the member who has lasted the longest on Earth of all the team. She is an operator within the ICS command center, and oversees the occurring of events from there. In case of an emergency, she can take over control from the whole place from her terminal, and prevent everyone else from doing anything.

    <h2><b>Abilities:</b></h2>
    She can learn pretty much anything just by looking at it for a bit. She knows the human anatomy, and can fire focused energy bursts at specific parts to effectively quickly kill large groups of enemies. She can also restrict people's movements around her. She also ages much slower than the others while on Earth.

    <h2><b>Backstory:</b></h2>
    Not much is known about her past, but she is one of the oldest members of them. She got in the ICS when it was founded from request of Victor Morika, as an operator for the command center. She remains present there for years, up to <b>The Invasion</b>, where the ICS gets destroyed and she goes back into the Void.

    <h2><b>Highlights:</b></h2>
    During <b>The Dismantlement</b>, as she received the call from Audrey and both she and Liakin got killed, she took over control of the command center, contacted Isa, and got her to go save Arya. She is one of the two masterminds of <i>them</i>, along with Quan.
