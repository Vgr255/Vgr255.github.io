SUMMARY = "Recruited by Victor Morika back when he was a taxi driver in downtown Manhattan, Jeremy was a founding member of the current ICS. He is a strong-willed fighter who puts the lives of his comrades before anything else, even his own. He is often seen on the front lines of any large-scale battle."

ABILITIES = "Unlike what could be thought, nobody can summon the Phoenix, as he is the Phoenix. He can morph into the Phoenix and can conceal himself as a white eagle. He can travel through the means of lines of fire he makes. He wields a powerful, magical sword."

BACKSTORY = "He was living in Manhattan with his girlfriend Emily as a taxi driver when Victor Morika came to recruit him, in 1999. He managed to convince him to come, and he got in the CIA. Not much is known about him prior to his recruitment in the CIA, besides that Jeremy Alexander isnâ€™t his real name. Presumably it starts by M, given his letter as part of them."

HIGHLIGHTS = "During the battle against Ghi's forces in 2026, he single-handedly defeated most of them, and helped Marisa create a wall to protect the ICS' forces while Katelyn and Ghi clashed. During The Great Battle in 2034, he managed to hold back most of the enemies and gained time while Simon and his squad were moving in position. He also led them to help Arya after Gerald sought their help."
