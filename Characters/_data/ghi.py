SUMMARY = "Ghi is a very powerful fighter, who can beat almost anyone. His weakness is his ego, as he believes there is no one greater than him alive. He fights and kills people as he wants to take revenge on the whole world for what he endured. As his hate grew, he slowly forgot everything about himself, including his name. He only remembers the letter he's been assigned as being part of them, but doesn't even remember what it means or who they are."

ABILITIES = "He is able to control most of the most powerful weapons out there, and is able to learn the abilities of the people he just killed (this doesn't apply to link-breaker Sumansian deaths, or to a Back-to-the-Void for <i>them</i>). He has a huge hatred towards Jeremy Alexander, who he considers like an enemy. Or so he thinks..."

BACKSTORY = "While he was still an infant, a serial killer came to kill him. His parents stepped in, but they both got killed. Victor Morika came in time to save him, but he was terrified. Victor immediately brought him to the Void, where he got in as one of them before coming back to Earth."

HIGHLIGHTS = "After The End, Ghi and Katelyn were brought back to the Void, only as infants. They then went back on Earth, where he atoned for his actions by joining the other Sumansians in their team, and fighting along them."
