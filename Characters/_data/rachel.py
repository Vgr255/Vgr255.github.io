SUMMARY = "Rachel is the member who has lasted the longest on Earth of all the team. She is an operator within the ICS command center, and oversees the occurring of events from there.

She also ages much slower than the others while on Earth."

BACKSTORY = "Not much is known about her past, but she is one of the oldest members of them. She got in the ICS when it was founded from request of Victor Morika, as an operator for the command center.

HIGHLIGHTS = "During <b>The Dismantlement</b>, as she received the call from Audrey and both she and Liakin got killed, she took over control of the command center, contacted Isa, and got her to go save Arya. She is one of the two masterminds of <i>them</i>, along with Quan."
