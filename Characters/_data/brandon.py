CLASS = "Oracle"

WEAPON = "Staff"

BIRTH = "January 13th, 1933"

BIRTH_LOCATION = "Portland, Oregon, USA, Earth"

LETTER = "B"

RECRUITMENT_ORDER = 8

SUMMARY = "He was born in the beginning of the twentieth century, and soon started to realize the powers he has. He was found and recruited by Victor Morika, and later helped recruit more members. He is not very social and won't talk much. He will usually get right to the point and avoid going around in circles. He's not a very good fighter, but is a very good backline supporter."

ABILITIES = "Can find anyone and anything near that emits magical energy, and can tell which kind. He's particularly useful in situations where a member of them dies and gets back into the Void, as he can find them rather easily, especially with the help of Fanny, who can control most animals, so he can move around quickly. He's not a very great fighter, but his staff holds much more power than is led to believe."

BACKSTORY = "He doesn't talk much of his past life, just like most of the team, and so his past is blurry and not well-known. We know he comes from Portland, Oregon, but that doesn't say much. Just like all of them, he ages very slowly while in the Void, and dying out there makes him get back in his old body. He had a sister, who passed away shortly before he came into the Void."

HIGHLIGHTS = "During <b>The Invasion</b>, he provides backup for the whole team as he's able to spot where the most significant magical creatures are. After the first wave is defeated, he turns insane as the summoner starts charging up for the second phase, since he can sense him everywhere. When Fanny gains control of the beast - Bahamut Ultimate - he can finally sense him precisely and leads the team back to the ground, where they engage him."
