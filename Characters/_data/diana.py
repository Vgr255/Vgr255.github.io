NAME = "Diana"

CLASS = "Bender"

LETTER = "D"

RECRUITMENT_ORDER = 18

SUMMARY = "She can bend matter around her and shape it in any way she sees fit. She will often use it to surf in midair by manipulating the shape of the air below her feet. She can carry someone else as well while she does that. She doesn't smile much, possibly because of past experiences, and she prefers to deal with matters (no pun intended) quickly and swiftly."

ABILITIES = "By being able to bend matter around her, she can not only surf in midair, but stop fugitives simply by making their escape means completely unusable. She will sometimes team up with PhaleÃ«n, Tania and sometimes Marisa, to restrict an enemy or protect an ally."

BACKSTORY = "Little is known about Diana's former family or her past before she joined them. Aside from Luke Walker, who recruited her, nobody really knows where she comes from."

HIGHLIGHTS = "While she cannot fight directly most of the times due to a lack of strength and proper weapons, she will usually provide frontline support, most of the times through blocking one's escape attempts or helping her allies to travel from and to the battlefield."

SUMMONS = ("Calamity", "Ramuh", "Valefor", "Ark", "Baalberith")
