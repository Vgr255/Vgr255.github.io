    <h2><b>Summary:</b></h2>
    Liakin can teleport herself and a few more people to a location that she already visited before, saw somewhere, or know exactly where it is (as to not end up in a wall). She wields two Mythril daggers, the Blue Bolt, which she can use to attack people, by teleporting.

    <h2><b>Abilities:</b></h2>
    Her fast speed and teleporting ability means she can easily dispatch a whole group of enemies. She's never static, teleporting back and forth between the front and back lines. She often aids Marisa by teleporting her to the wounded, or the other way around. She's also able to communicate with other people through telepathy.

    <h2><b>Backstory:</b></h2>
    She used to be nothing more than a simple civilian, but the ICS had decided to track and protect her, as they determined she had some potential. When some of Ghi's men decide to attack her and Marisa, Jeremy Alexander goes to save them. Then, to protect them further, he trained Liakin, and she became much stronger. She later joined <i>them</i>.

    <h2><b>Highlights:</b></h2>
    During most of the large-scale battles the S-Team undertook, she was always there, teleporting back and forth between the battlefield and the ICS, where Marisa would heal the wounded.
