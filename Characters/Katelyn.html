    <h2><b>Summary:</b></h2>
    Katelyn is strong and able to control the space around her, making it possible to become invisible. She can also stop anyone in their motion, and can redirect simple attacks. She was the first member of the S-Team, in the S Division, and founded what is currently known as the ICS.

    <h2><b>Abilities:</b></h2>
    She can craft weapons from nothing using magic, and she can control the wind to fly herself or others. She is a very good fighter, although she prefers to avoid fighting and instead prepare the operations. She works closely with Rachel and Michael.

    <h2><b>Backstory:</b></h2>
    Recruited by Victor Morika when she was still young, she got into <i>them</i>, and Victor started the S-Team with the help of Luke Walker, atop which Katelyn was standing. She helped recruit most of the other members of the S-Team, and later moved on to the ICS.

    <h2><b>Highlights:</b></h2>
    During <b>The End</b>, she monitored the fight from her office, and when most of the enemies were down, she flew over to the battlefield. Jeremy Alexander and Marisa Merkel brought up a protective shield to protect the ICS allies, as Katelyn stopped the enemies and advanced to attack Ghi Martin.
