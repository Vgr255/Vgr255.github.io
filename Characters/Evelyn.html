    <h2><b>Summary:</b></h2>
    Evelyn is a very gifted magician, being able to control almost all existing magics in existence. She lacks physical strength, however her knowledge of advanced spells more than make up for it. She will very rarely take direct action in battles, staying in the back and supporting with spells of her own.

    <h2><b>Abilities:</b></h2>
    By being able to control most basic spells as well as advanced ones, Evelyn makes up for a very talented mage. She can cast Ultima, being able to wipe out an entire city. She can also summon one of the Bahamut entities all by herself.

    <h2><b>Backstory:</b></h2>
    Due to her age, little is known about her past, besides where she originated from. It's not even sure whether 'Evelyn' was her original name. Much like most of them, her memory does not always serve her right, and dying on the battlefield makes her forget a lot of things, too.

    <h2><b>Highlights:</b></h2>
    During The Void Invasion, she used her most powerful spells, wiping out most of the Void, to protect her friends and family. The tremendous amount of power that was unleashed on that day forced the closing of the portal and killed most of the invaders, eventually saving them from being extinct.
