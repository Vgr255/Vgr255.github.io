    He can manipulate the portals he or someone else create, and allow for both friend and foe to travel. He can sense immediately whenever a portal is opened somewhere, as he's able to sense the boundaries of a world.

    <h2><b>Backstory:</b></h2>
    Jordan always knew he was different. He had no friends, and spent most of his time alone trying to do magic as he called it. One day, that went too well and he fell into the Void. He was not able to get back after this, but found <i>them</i>, and decided to join the team.

    <h2><b>Highlights:</b></h2>
    For each of the major fights there is, he's always in the back, creating and manipulating portals, allowing his allies to move more freely, and his enemies to be restricted in their moves.
