    <h2><b>Summary:</b></h2>
    Ashlyn is a very talented summoner, who can summon any magical creature, no matter where she is or what the creatures are. She has control over a summon of each element, plus many of the most powerful ones.

    <h2><b>Abilities:</b></h2>
    While she cannot fight directly due to a lack of weapon and strength, she is very useful in battle as she can provide strong cover through summoning, and can also aid in escaping.

    <h2><b>Backstory:</b></h2>
    Her father, Michael Cormier, was part of the HLCF (which later became known as the ICS) when she was born.  From a very young age, she was able to control animals and even make some appear. After helping Jeremy Alexander through the Void, he got his daughter as part of them, both to exploit her skills and protect her. She grew with them and became stronger than ever before.

    <h2><b>Highlights:</b></h2>
    Ashlyn is the one who keeps all the creatures away from their home, in the Void. She can also summon them to come to their aid, most of the time.
