    <h2><b>Summary:</b></h2>
    He is a very strong-willed fighter, who will always fight until either he or his enemies give their last breath. He holds a strong bond of friendship with them, and will never hesitate to jump in should any of them be in harm's way.

    <h2><b>Abilities:</b></h2>
    Besides his strong will to fight, Charles doesn't have much power of himself. However, his Joint dagger is consisted of two daggers which he can connect together by the end of the handle, and can throw this two-ended dagger at foes, and it behaves like a boomerang in most regards.

    <h2><b>Backstory:</b></h2>
    Born in France, his parents moved out to Hungary when he was 10. Shortly after, an explosion occurred near their house, and Charles was stuck in his room, unable to move. Through the extreme heat, he decided to get out and save his parents. He could save his father, but his mother perished in the fire. He and his father moved out to a smaller apartment, starting over with nothing but yet-to-come insurance money. He was found by Jordan, who had seen what happened. He recruited him in the team, and trained him so he would become stronger.

    <h2><b>Highlights:</b></h2>
    After they started being picked apart, he fought not only for his life but for his comrades, and managed to kill most of his attackers, not without taking some damage, before Marisa, Gerald, Arya and Mike joined in to help.
