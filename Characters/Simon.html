    Simon can change his appearance or that of anyone else he touches, and can reads minds and even control them to a certain extent. He can take the form and voice of anyone else, making him a very effective spy for whichever side he decides to play for.

    <h2><b>Abilities:</b></h2>
    As well as being able to change his appearance and read minds, he can also create duplicates of The Masamune, a really powerful katana. He can obtain this and more weapons by summoning Gilgamesh, who wields all the weapons. He can then use them to his liking.

    <h2><b>Backstory:</b></h2>
    He was recruited by Ghi before the ICS could find him, and he became Ghi's right hand. On his demand, he infiltrated the ICS, charming Amelia Bater. Jeremy Alexander didn't like him and asked Marisa to follow him; one day he sees her and kills her, falling in pain and revealing she was his Sumansian twin, and that they effectively were Sumansian. After that event, he decided to secretly help the ICS and the S-Team.

    <h2><b>Highlights:</b></h2>
    During <b>The Great Battle</b>, Simon and some of Ghi's former mercenaries infiltrate the base of the enemy to go and kill the resistance. However, the base explodes and no one survives, save for Simon who got back in the Void, except a few years younger by then.
