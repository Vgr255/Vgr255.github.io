    <h2><b>Summary:</b></h2>
    Isa is a really powerful ally, able to adapt to many situations and withstand large amounts of damage. Even while attacked, she can attack and kill those who attack her. She's extremely powerful, and wields a powerful spear.

    <h2><b>Abilities:</b></h2>
    Besides being able to adapt to any situation, she can also easily kill most of her enemies from deviated energy bursts. She has a good physical strength, albeit not as much as Noémie.

    <h2><b>Backstory:</b></h2>
    Isa, an orphan, was found stealing and robbing by Audrey, who brought her into the Void before she got in any more trouble. Isa trained herself with the help of her comrades, and became even stronger. She went back on Earth to help maintain some sort of stability, and is always there when they need her.

    <h2><b>Highlights:</b></h2>
    When Audrey found out that they were being hunted down, she told Rachel, who then called Isa for support. Isa quickly and easily dispatched the dozens of people who came to kill her, and survived through a few rockets and countless bullets.
