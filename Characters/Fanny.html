    <h2><b>Summary:</b></h2>
    Fanny is a cheerful ever-young girl, who can impose her will on any living creature, provided their intelligence is low enough to allow it. Her physical strength isn't great, and neither is her magical power. Whenever there are creatures involved, she will rush in and control them. She is always laughing and smiling, knowing that she might forget everything that she experienced.

    <h2><b>Abilities:</b></h2>
    She can control any animal or magical beast, making her surprisingly effective against a summoner. Having been raised in the Void by wild animals, she has a close link with most of them. She can summon some creatures, although she isn't really good at it, and will rarely resort to doing so. She can run relatively fast, and will usually fight like a wild animal.

    <h2><b>Backstory:</b></h2>
    Since she was raised by wild animals in the Void, there’s no way to know where she came from before that. She has a youngish personality, which is reflected in her appearance, manners and fighting style. Her mother was also the mother of Isa and Zoe, and one of the few metamorphs.

    <h2><b>Highlights:</b></h2>
    During <b>The Invasion</b>, she fights alongside the rest of her team to defend the Earth. When Bahamut Ultimate is summoned, she runs up to its head and begins to take control over it. She then makes it come back to fetch everyone, standing on the top of its head. She managed to control one of the most powerful summons by standing on its head.
