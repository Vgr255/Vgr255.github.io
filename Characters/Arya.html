    <h2><b>Summons:</b></h2>

      <li><i>Alexander</i> (Arya)</li>
      <li><i>Zeromus</i> (Arya, Ashlyn Cormier)</li>

    </ul>

    <h2><b>Summary:</b></h2>
    She is the goal that the early members of the secret Sumansian division of the CIA (Katelyn Jackson, Amelia Bater, Ghi Martin and Victor Morika) sought. They learned that Sumansians were always twins, with a strong bond between them, and thus their power was spread between the two. By making two twins have a child together, they expected to get a super powerful ally. Arya is several times stronger than both her parents combined.

    <h2><b>Abilities:</b></h2>
    Can manipulate most kinds of energy, lend her powers to someone else, or attack directly, with any power source (such as an electrical outlet, thunder, etc). She can summon all three summons tied to her element of predilection (Alexander, Zeromus and Dragon), albeit not all of them can she alone. She can summon the most powerful creature of the world by herself, although others can summon it in group too.

    <h2><b>Backstory:</b></h2>
    She secretly joins <i>them</i> after her father died, as well as Liakin, leading to the completion of the team. When Amelia dies, Alexander asks Liakin and Marisa to take care of her, as he can no longer keep fighting while taking care of her. Arya holds her foster mothers very close in her heart.

    <h2><b>Highlights:</b></h2>
    When her father died in <b>The Great Battle</b>, she went into the Void with Gerald, Liakin and Marisa. She found him, but he had no idea who she was. Quan, however, remembered, and managed to get Zoe to recruit her, due to her extreme potential. She can summon the most powerful creature all by herself. During The Invasion, she chases the summoner downtown, and blocks him before he can escape.
